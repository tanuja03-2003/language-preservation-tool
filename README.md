"Echoes of Vanishing Voices: Reviving Endangered Languages" is an AI-powered initiative focused on preserving endangered languages like Konkani and Lambani in Karnataka. 
The project harnesses Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Speech Recognition to build an interactive tool that enables language documentation,  and translation. 
It supports linguistic research, community contributions, and interactive learning modules to engage native speakers. 
By integrating these features into a collaborative digital platform, the project bridges traditional linguistic heritage with modern technology to promote sustainable language regeneration.
